# Benchmarking Identity-based Encryption Systems in Rust

## Getting Started
The project uses a standard Rust `cargo` setup. To get started, try the following

1. `cargo build` builds the package and its dependencies
2. `cargo clean` removes all built artifacts
3. `cargo run` executes the main binary (which simply prints "Hello" for now)
4. `cargo test` executes the unit/integration tests and reports successes/failures
5. `cargo bench` executes the benchmarking targets and reports the timings
6. `cargo fmt` format the entire codebase to follow unified coding style
